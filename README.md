# Simple Linear Regression Model

Welcome to the Simple Linear Regression Model repository! This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a linear regression model, showcasing how to predict a continuous target variable based on a single feature.

## 🗂️ Contents

1. **Reading Dataset**  
   We begin by loading the dataset, ensuring that it’s clean and ready for analysis. The dataset forms the foundation of our regression model.

2. **Feature and Label Data Set**  
   Next, we separate the dataset into features (independent variables) and labels (dependent variables). This step is crucial for training the model.

3. **Splitting Training and Testing Set**  
   To evaluate our model's performance, we split the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to assess its accuracy.

4. **Linear Regression Model**  
   We then create and train a simple linear regression model. This model will find the best-fit line that represents the relationship between the feature and the label.

5. **Visualizing Training Set**  
   After training, we visualize the results on the training set. This visualization helps in understanding how well the model has learned from the data.

6. **Visualizing Testing Set**  
   Finally, we visualize the model's predictions on the testing set. This step helps us evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## 📊 Example Results

Below are some visualizations from the model:

- **Training Set**: A plot of the training data points along with the regression line.
- **Testing Set**: A plot of the testing data points and the model's predictions.
